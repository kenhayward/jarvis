"""Reading a repository, cheaply.

JARVIS could see what SESSIONS were doing and knew nothing about the CODE.
Asking "what does chitauri actually do" or "where's the auth logic" meant
spawning a run: minutes of wall clock and a slice of the subscription, for a
question a grep answers in milliseconds.

So these are primitives, not intelligence. No model, no `claude` subprocess,
no network — three bounded filesystem reads that the brain composes. It
already reasons; this gives it eyes.

Everything here is SYNCHRONOUS and blocking on purpose. The voice loop must
never wait on a disk walk, so `server.py` calls all of it through
`asyncio.to_thread`. The one asynchronous entry point is `search`, which
prefers ripgrep when it is installed and otherwise falls back to the pure
walk below — no new dependency either way.

Two rules govern every function:

1. **Bounded.** A repository can be a million files across a network mount.
   Every walk has a depth, a file count, a byte budget and a wall-clock
   deadline, and stops at whichever it hits first. A truncated answer that
   arrives in 40 ms beats a complete one that stalls the microphone.
2. **Nothing sensitive, ever.** The user's home directory is itself a
   "project" on this machine, which makes containment alone far too
   permissive — `~/.ssh/id_rsa` is "inside a project". So containment is the
   floor, not the ceiling: `sensitive_reason` refuses credentials, keys,
   dotfile directories and `.env` outright, even inside a legitimate repo,
   and the walk never lists or greps them either.

# reached his whole data directory. Confirmed live:
# `{"project": "jarvis", "path": "data/jarvis/mcp.json"}` returned the
# tool-token file's path and every `env` block the user had written into
# `connections.json`, which is the file they are told to paste credentials
# into. `read_file` is not an acting tool, so no origin gate stood in the
# way; `WebFetch` is the CLI's own ungated tool, so the exfiltration leg was
# free.
#
# `SENSITIVE_EXACT` held "tool-token" and nothing else in there. `mcp.json`,
# `connections.json`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/`, `projects/`, `journal/` and
# `jarvis.db` were all readable, and the last four are what `CLAUDE.md`
# `@`-imports into every turn as trusted system text.
#
# By ABSOLUTE PATH and not by name, deliberately: a project may legitimately
# hold its own `mcp.json` or `MEMORY.md`, and the user is entitled to ask
# about those. The whole data directory goes in one line rather than seven
# filenames, so a file added to it later is covered without anybody
# remembering to come back here.
