"""The review surface: what JARVIS proposes, and what JARVIS produced.

`builds.py` is the producer — it writes the spec into the project and spawns
the session that writes the phased plan. This module is the *reader*, and it
exists because of one thing the user said out loud:

    "JARVIS needs to open a clean/simple UI for specs and plans for people to
    actually see it and communicate feedback to JARVIS by voice."

`superpowers:brainstorming` has a hard human-approval gate, and the gate is
there to get a *human's* approval. You cannot approve a sixty-line spec that
was read aloud to you. The gate needs an eye — so the document goes on a page
and the answer comes back by voice.

Three things are load-bearing.

1. **Numbering is the mechanism, not decoration.** The user says "change
   three", "drop five", "approved". That only works if the number they say
   resolves to the same section on both sides of the conversation, so there
   is exactly ONE function that numbers a document — `sections_of` — and both
   readers call it: the `/api/specs` payload the page renders, and the
   `review_document` tool JARVIS answers from. Neither counts headings for
   itself. Numbering is a pure function of the file's text: no clock, no
   database, no ordering that a second reader could get wrong.

2. **Approval is a recorded act.** `start_build` used to *assume* the design
   was approved, which meant a restart forgot it and a revision inherited it.
   Approval is now a small JSON file in the project, beside the spec and the
   plan, holding a digest of the exact text that was approved. That is what
   makes the third state possible: a document whose text no longer matches
   its approval is **superseded**, and needs the user's eye again.

3. **This reads files from arbitrary project directories**, off a path that
   arrived in a URL. Containment is decided by `repo_read.resolve_within` —
   the existing precedent, which resolves both sides so a symlink, a `..` and
   an absolute path all fail identically — and then narrowed again to the two
   directories documents actually live in.

No server imports, no asyncio, no subprocess: `server.py` calls all of it,
the blocking parts through `asyncio.to_thread`.
