REGENERATE THIS WHENEVER `frontend/src/orb.ts` CHANGES. Every pixel in both
files is a live WebGL render of that module — the real Three.js particle
system, in its real "speaking" state, with nothing composited, drawn on, or
retouched afterwards.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/make_orb_loop.py

Needs Playwright's Chromium (already in .venv), `ffmpeg` on PATH, and
`frontend/node_modules` installed (esbuild, which ships as a Vite dependency,
bundles the orb module). It adds no dependency of its own.

    --reference     re-take the real-AnalyserNode measurement below and stop
    --frames-only   render the PNG frames and stop, so you can look at them
    --seconds / --fps / --width / --height / --crossfade   as they say
    --scale         supersampling factor; 1 turns it off, and it shows

WHAT IS SYNTHETIC AND WHAT IS NOT
---------------------------------
The *input* is synthetic; the *output* is a real render.

`orb.ts` only knows it is talking through an `AnalyserNode`: each frame it
calls `getByteFrequencyData`, sums bins 0-7 into `bass` and bins 8-23 into
`mid`, and those two numbers drive the pulse (`mat.size + bass * 0.05`, the
opacity lift, the Z-breathing `- bass * 10`, the outward shove on `bass > 0.05`
and the per-particle syllable pulse on `mid > 0.1`). So this script hands the
orb an object shaped exactly like an `AnalyserNode` whose spectrum is a
speech-shaped envelope computed from the frame clock. Synthesising real TTS
would spend the user's Fish Audio quota and change nothing on screen.

The envelope is not guesswork, and it is not eyeballed off a video. It was
fitted to a measurement of a REAL `AnalyserNode`, configured exactly the way
`voice.ts` configures the one the app uses (fftSize 256, smoothingTimeConstant
0.8) and fed a 4.5 Hz-gated 120 Hz sawtooth through a formant lowpass at TTS
playback level, in the same headless Chromium. `--reference` takes that
measurement again — it is a WebAudio graph, it spends no quota and needs no
network. In steady state it gave the orb:

    in a phrase   bass 0.63 - 0.87 (mean 0.77)   mid 0.35 - 0.64 (mean 0.52)
    in the gap    bass -> 0.00                   mid -> 0.00
    a syllable is worth about +-0.1 of bass; the phrase gap is worth all of it

(That is one run of `--reference`. It samples a live audio graph off the wall
clock, so a repeat moves the ends of the ranges by a few hundredths; the middle
is stable.)

Two things worth knowing, because they decide what the loop should look like.
First, the analyser's own 0.8 smoothing eats most of the 4.5 Hz syllable, so
the big visible event in real speech is the PHRASE GAP, not the syllable.
Second, the byte spectrum is a decibel scale, so it rolls off almost linearly
across the bins rather than dying away — which is why `mid` sits at about 0.68
of `bass` rather than a tenth of it.

SPEECH_* below are fitted to reproduce all of that through the same smoothing
(bass 0.62-0.87 mean 0.77, mid 0.43-0.60 mean 0.53, floor 0.03), and every run
prints what it actually produced next to the measured numbers so the fit can be
checked rather than trusted. The one place this differs in kind from the real
node: the smoothing here is applied to the bytes rather than to the linear
magnitudes underneath them.

HOW THE LOOP IS MADE TO CLOSE
-----------------------------
Nothing in `orb.ts` has a period. The camera drifts on `sin(t*0.02)` and
`cos(t*0.03)`, the cloud breathes on `sin(t*0.15)` while speaking, and the
2000 particles are a damped random walk that never revisits a state. Three
things are done about that, in order of how much they buy:

1. A VIRTUAL CLOCK. The harness page replaces `performance.now` and
   `requestAnimationFrame` before the orb module loads, so every frame is
   advanced by hand at exactly 1/60 s — the rate the app runs at. The frame
   times are then exact rather than whatever the machine managed, which is what
   lets step 2 mean anything. `Math.random` is seeded in the same place and for
   a duller reason: the orb scatters its 2000 particles with it, so without a
   seed the file is different every time it is regenerated. Between them the
   whole render is reproducible — the same command gives the same bytes.

2. AN ENVELOPE WHOSE PERIOD IS THE LOOP. Every component of the synthetic
   speech is a whole number of cycles per loop (at the 6 s default: 3 phrases,
   27 syllables = 4.5 Hz, a 21-cycle flutter = 3.5 Hz, one slow swell). The
   script refuses to run if any of them is not. So the audio-driven half of the
   motion — the pulse, the size, the opacity, the Z lunge — is bit-identical at
   both ends of the loop.

3. A CROSSFADE over the half that cannot be made periodic. The clock does not
   start at 0: `best_start()` sweeps for the instant at which the camera and
   breathing sinusoids come closest to returning to themselves one loop later.
   At the 6 s default that is t = 531.6 s, and it leaves a seam worth about
   3.5 px of apparent motion where a naive start at t=0 would leave 15.1 px.
   The clock is simply jumped there during warm-up, before anything is filmed,
   so it costs nothing but a print. A 1 s crossfade buries what is left.

   The crossfade is the standard loop construction: capture N+K frames, then
   replace the first K with `a*frame[j] + (1-a)*frame[N+j]`, a ramping 0 to 1.
   Frame N+j is exactly one loop-period after frame j, so the two agree on
   everything in (2) and disagree only on the camera drift and the particle
   positions, which are a statistically identical cloud either way. The wrap
   itself (output frame N-1 back to output frame 0) is exactly continuous,
   because output frame 0 IS frame N.

   Verified, not assumed: the script prints the PSNR across the wrap next to
   the median PSNR between ordinary neighbouring frames. If the wrap is not
   worse than an ordinary frame step, there is no seam to find.

GIF, WEBP, AND WHY THERE IS NO BORDER
-------------------------------------
Both are written. The GIF is what the README uses, because it renders
everywhere, and at these settings it lands at 2.8 MiB — under the 3 MiB a
README should ask anyone to download, but only just. The WebP is the same 90
frames at 1.2 MiB and a visibly cleaner picture; swapping the README's one line
to it is a fair trade the day size matters more than compatibility does.

The orb page is `#050508`, so on GitHub's light theme this is a dark rectangle
on a white page. Nothing is padded, drawn, or matted around it: a border would
be the one thing in the file that is not a render of the orb. What keeps it
from reading as a hole is the framing — the glow runs most of the way to the
edges of a frame this size — and the caption sitting directly under it.
