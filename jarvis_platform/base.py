"""What a platform can do, and which tools depend on it.

JARVIS drives the machine it runs on, so a second platform is not a matter
of translating each subprocess — some of what he does has no equivalent
elsewhere, and some has one that has not been built yet. This module is how
that is stated, once, rather than discovered by a tool failing.

The rule, and it is the reason this is a set of capabilities rather than a
set of try/excepts: **a platform that cannot do something withdraws the
tool, it does not fake it.** A tool that always answers "not supported on
this platform" is described to the brain on every single turn at roughly
250 tokens, invites it to try anyway, and gives it something to apologise
for. A tool the brain never sees costs nothing and cannot be misused.

Capabilities are deliberately named after the *behaviour*, not the module
or the API. `screen_capture` is a thing JARVIS can or cannot do;
`screencapture` is how one platform happens to do it.

# 2. Nothing raises. Every path returns an outcome string, so the caller can
#    always say something useful and always has something to audit.
#
# The third — that the target is found by IDENTITY and never by focus — can
# only be kept by an implementation, because what identifies a terminal
# differs per platform. It is the protocol's central promise all the same;
