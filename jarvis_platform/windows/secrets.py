"""Files only their owner may read, the Windows way.

**Written from documentation, not from measurement.** Everything else in
this repository is measured on the machine it runs on; this could not be,
because it was written on a Mac. The two things that could be wrong are
isolated so a real Windows box can correct them in one place each:
`_parse_aces` (what `icacls` prints) and `_parse_whoami` (what
`whoami /user /fo csv /nh` prints). `tests/test_windows_secrets.py` pins
both against sample output — replace the samples with real ones and the
tests will say whether anything else has to move.

POSIX states the requirement as "mode 0600, and do not follow symlinks".
Neither half survives translation: `O_NOFOLLOW`, `getuid` and `fchmod` do
not exist here. Windows says the same thing as a DACL, so the requirement
becomes "break inheritance, then grant exactly one principal".

`icacls` rather than pywin32, per CLAUDE.md's rule that a dependency has to
earn its place: this needs two commands at boot and nothing else, `icacls`
and `whoami` have shipped with Windows since Vista, and a package that
exists only on one platform would have to be conditional in
`requirements.txt` for a saving of about forty lines.

Three things are load-bearing and should survive any rewrite:

1. **The identity of what we opened is confirmed.** Windows has no
   `O_NOFOLLOW`, so the file is `lstat`-ed first (which does not follow),
   rejected if it is a reparse point — that covers symlinks AND directory
   junctions — then opened, and the open descriptor's `(st_dev, st_ino)` is
   compared with the `lstat`'s. If they differ, something was swapped
   between the two calls and we refuse. That is the closest Windows gets to
   the single-descriptor discipline the POSIX side uses.

2. **Adoption requires the DACL we would have written.** Not an owner
   check — Windows has no cheap standard-library equivalent of `getuid` —
   but something stronger for this purpose: a file whose DACL is not
   exactly one ACE granting this user full control is a file we did not
   create, so it is refused rather than adopted. Adopting somebody else's
   file would mean trusting a token they chose and know.

3. **A file we cannot lock down is deleted, not left.** If `icacls` fails
   after `create_private` has made the file, the file is removed before the
   error propagates. A token sitting at inherited permissions is precisely
   what this module exists to prevent.

    * `/inheritance:r` removes only the ACEs marked `(I)`.
    * `/grant:r` replaces the grant for the principal it NAMES, and touches
      no other.

    So an EXPLICIT ACE belonging to somebody else survives both, and the
    pair leaves the file exactly as wide as it found it. Add SYSTEM,
    Administrators and OWNER RIGHTS to a file explicitly and run the
    lock-down: four ACEs come back, our grant among them and nothing gone.
    Run `icacls <file> /reset` first — it discards every explicit ACE and
    restores inheritance — and the same lock-down leaves the one ACE this
    module promises.

    That is the whole of the CI failure, and it corrects the guess in the
    commit before this one. The runner's temp files carry those three as
    EXPLICIT ACEs, not inherited ones, which is why identical code yields a
    single ACE on an ordinary desktop account and four on the runner. Sixty
    three of the Windows leg's sixty five failures were this.
