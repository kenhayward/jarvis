"""Which platform JARVIS is running on, and what it can therefore do.

Named `jarvis_platform` and not `platform`, which would be a top-level
package in the repository root and therefore ahead of the standard library
on `sys.path` for the whole process — `server.py` runs from that directory,
so a package called `platform` would shadow the stdlib module of that name
for uvicorn, httpx and Playwright alike. The `jarvis_` prefix follows
`jarvis_memory` and `jarvis_mcp`.

Selection happens once, at import. `current()` is a function rather than a
constant so a test can put a different host in front of it (see
`jarvis_platform.fake`) without reloading every module that reads it.
