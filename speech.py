        read-back" before opening the cancel window. It also defeated the
        prefetch gate (`sent - played < prefetch`), emptying the whole
        utterance into the socket at once, and dropped an URGENT utterance's
        remaining text from `_unread`.

        Only the page itself can send this (the Origin gate holds), so it is
        a buggy or racing tab rather than an attacker — which is why this
        drops the frame and logs it instead of closing the connection. An ack
        that is merely late or duplicated is still simply ignored.

        The bound is `high_sent`, not `sent`: a preemption and a resume
        bridge both roll `sent` backwards, and an ack already in the air for
        a chunk that really did go out must still count.
