"""What the CLI last told us about the subscription's limits.

JARVIS runs on a Claude Code subscription, not on an API key — `claude_env`
scrubs every `ANTHROPIC_*` variable precisely so the CLI can never bill one.
So there is no spend to report. What there IS, and what the user actually
asks for out loud ("what's my session limit"), is how much of the five-hour
and seven-day windows has been used.

That number arrives in exactly one place: a `rate_limit_event` on the brain's
stdout, which the CLI sends only while a turn is in flight. The brain used it
for a backoff and threw it away. This module is where it is kept.

  record(rate_limit_info)   persist one observation (called by brain.py)
  latest()                  the raw stored record, or None
  snapshot()                what /api/usage returns

THE ONE RULE
------------
Absence is a state, and it is preserved as one. A window nobody has observed
comes back with `utilization: None` — never 0, never a full green gauge. A
user who has burned 84% of their week and sees an empty gauge because the
brain has not taken a turn yet is worse off than one who is told "not
measured". Every reading is stamped with when it was taken, per window, so
the reader can tell four minutes ago from four hours ago.

ENCODING
--------
`utilization` is a FRACTION in the payload: 0.78 means 78%. Measured live on
2026-09-02 — the CLI sent `"utilization": 0.76` on the same event that the
brain logged as "seven_day window at 76%". A fraction cannot exceed 1, so a
value above 1 is read as an already-percent encoding rather than doubled up
into 5500%.
