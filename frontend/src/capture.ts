/**
 * capture.ts — the page hearing an utterance and handing the audio to the
 * server, for the `whisper` STT backend.
 *
 * Only used when `JARVIS_STT_BACKEND` is not `browser`. On the default
 * install nothing here runs and `voice.ts` keeps doing what it always did.
 *
 * WHY THE PAGE STILL DOES THE LISTENING, when the point of phase 4 is to move
 * recognition off the browser:
 *
 * The browser applies acoustic echo cancellation to `getUserMedia`, using its
 * own render stream as the reference. Measured 2026-09-10 — `{audio: true}`
 * grants `echoCancellation: true`, and capturing through it while JARVIS
 * spoke transcribed the user with no trace of him, where a raw microphone tap
 * of the same moment transcribed JARVIS instead. That cancellation is only
 * available here, in the page, where the audio is also being played. Ship the
 * raw microphone to the server and it is thrown away.
 *
 * So: the page hears, the server recognises. Endpointing lives with the audio
 * and the echo cancellation; transcription lives where the model is.
 *
 * The endpointer this replaces is Chrome's, and `speech.py` records its
 * measured behaviour — it closes a segment when his voice tails off and hands
 * the user's FIRST WORD over as a final on its own, 1-2s later. That is the
 * bar. `SILENCE_MS` below is deliberately short for the same reason: a
 * generous tail sounds careful and eats the beginning of the reply.

/**
 * A KNOWN COMPROMISE, stated rather than left to be discovered:
 * `ScriptProcessorNode` is deprecated. `AudioWorklet` is its replacement and
 * runs the audio callback off the main thread, which is the right place for
 * it.
 *
 * ScriptProcessor is used here anyway because AudioWorklet needs its
 * processor in a separate module fetched at runtime, and getting that served
 * correctly through Vite in both dev and build is a build problem rather than
 * an audio one — worth solving, but not worth solving first, and not worth
 * getting wrong in the commit that introduces the whole path.
 *
 * The work in the callback is one pass over 4096 floats to find a peak, which
 * is trivial next to the Three.js orb already running on that thread. If
 * capture ever stutters, this is the first thing to move.
