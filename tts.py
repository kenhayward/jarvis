"""
tts.py — one sentence chunk in, one complete audio blob out.

Three backends behind one call:

    say    macOS's own synthesiser, and the default. Offline, no key, no
           dependency, nothing to bill. Measured on this project's Mac with
           the en_GB voice Daniel: ~0.45s per sentence whatever its length —
           the cost is process startup, not synthesis — against 1.2-3.5s of
           audio, so it stays comfortably ahead of the mouth.
    piper  A neural voice, still local and still offline, at the price of one
           dependency (piper-tts, which brings onnxruntime) and a ~63 MB model
           per voice. Measured with en_GB-alan-medium on the same Mac: 0.67s
           per sentence warm (1.30s on the first call, while onnxruntime warms
           up) against 1.2-4.0s of audio. Slower than `say` and markedly less
           robotic.
    fish   Fish Audio, the original hosted voice. Needs FISH_API_KEY, and is
           reached only by asking for it: JARVIS_TTS_BACKEND=fish.

The Fish response is streamed so time-to-first-byte can be measured. Neither
local backend can stream: `say` seeks its output file to write the WAV header,
so `-o -` yields zero bytes (measured), and piper is handed the same kind of
output path. For those, `first_byte_sec` IS the total. Either way the chunk is
returned whole, because the browser decodes one complete blob per chunk and
`speech.ack_floor_seconds` needs a whole container to read a length out of.

Two things make the format change safe. The audio frame carries no MIME type
(server.py base64s it into a `{"type": "audio"}` message) and the browser's
`decodeAudioData` sniffs the container, so WAV needs no frontend change; and
`speech.wav_seconds` was added alongside `mp3_seconds` so the ack floor still
has a length to work from — without it every local chunk would be a blob with
no floor, which is the older, worse resume behaviour.

The text goes to both local backends over STDIN, never as an argument. It is
model-written and arrives through speech recognition, so a chunk beginning
"-r 500 ..." would otherwise be read as flags — the same reasoning
gh_lookup.py applies to `gh`, one step further because here the input is not
even the user's own words.
