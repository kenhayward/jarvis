"""The URL that reaches `open location` is DATA, proved against a real
AppleScript interpreter.

The launcher's `browser` escaped `"` and not `\\`, thirty-eight lines below the
helper that does both. That is not a theoretical hole: AppleScript reads
`\\\\` as one literal backslash, so a URL ending `x\\"` closes the string
literal and everything after it is CODE — and `do shell script` is in that
language. `applescript_escape` orders the two replacements correctly
(backslash first, then quote), which is the whole difference.

Nothing here launches a browser. `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` is replaced
by a recorder, and the *recorded script's own URL literal* is then executed
through `osascript` inside a harness with the same shape as the real one — a
statement whose argument is that literal. A payload that escapes the literal
runs in that harness exactly as it would inside the `tell` block.

The payload writes a marker file. Its absence is the assertion, and
`test_the_payload_really_is_an_attack` runs the SAME payload through the old
escape to prove the marker can be written — without that, "the marker is
absent" would prove nothing at all.
