# --- Criticals 1 & 2: the read-back must not be queued behind its own turn --
#
# `tool_steer_session` is called BY THE BRAIN, MID-TURN, through the MCP
# child. At that moment `speech.begin_turn()`'s utterance is open, and the
# scheduler will not advance past an open utterance. A read-back said from
# inside the tool call is therefore queued behind the very turn that is
# blocked waiting for the call to return — a deadlock broken only by the MCP
# child's 20s timeout, after which the brain is told the server is
# unreachable and the server sends the message anyway. JARVIS announced a
# failure and then did it: the read-back-then-cancel gate defeated entirely.
#
# Neither FakeSpeech (which returns instantly from everything) nor the
# scheduler tests (which never combine begin_turn with a steer) could see
# that. These drive the REAL SpeechScheduler through the REAL
# `server._handle_utterance`, with a brain that calls the tool mid-turn.
