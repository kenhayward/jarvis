"""JARVIS's own data directory is not a readable part of any project.

`data/` defaults to a directory INSIDE JARVIS's own repository, and
`_repo_project` resolves "yourself" to that repository. So `read_file` on his
own source reached the whole of it. Confirmed live before this was closed:

    tool_read_file({"project": "jarvis", "path": "data/jarvis/mcp.json"})

came back with the tool-token file's path and every `env` block the user had
written into `connections.json` — which is the file the documentation tells
them to paste credentials into. `read_file` is not an acting tool, so no
origin gate stood in the way, and until the previous commit no taint did
either; `WebFetch` is the CLI's own ungated tool, so the exfiltration leg was
free.

`repo_read.sensitive_reason` refused `tool-token` by exact name and nothing
else in there. `mcp.json`, `connections.json`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/`,
`projects/`, `journal/` and `jarvis.db` were all readable.

The wall is by ABSOLUTE PATH, not by name: a project may legitimately hold
its own `mcp.json` or `MEMORY.md` and the user is entitled to ask about
those. `test_a_projects_own_mcp_json_is_still_readable` is the half of this
that stops the fix from being a blunt name ban.
