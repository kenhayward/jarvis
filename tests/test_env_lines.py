"""What counts as a LINE in `.env`, and who gets to decide.

The writer blocked three characters — `"\\n"`, `"\\r"`, `"\\0"`. Every reader
of the file splits it with `str.splitlines()`, which splits on ten. The gap
was a one-request exploit, confirmed against a live server:

    POST /api/settings/preferences
    {"user_name": "Tony\\x0bJARVIS_CLAUDE_PATH=/tmp/evil", "honorific": "sir"}
    -> 200
    _read_env() -> {..., 'JARVIS_CLAUDE_PATH': '/tmp/evil'}

`JARVIS_CLAUDE_PATH` is the binary the brain is spawned from, and
`POST /api/restart` is one call away.

The class of input here is not "the newline" and it is not "these eleven
characters" either — a list typed by hand is exactly what failed the first
time. It is **every character the reader treats as a line boundary**, so
this file DERIVES the set by asking `str.splitlines()` over the whole
Unicode range, and derives the writer's rule from the reader's parser rather
than from a second list that has to be kept in step by hand.

Sweeping all of Unicode costs about a tenth of a second, which is the price
of never having to trust that somebody remembered `\\x85`.
