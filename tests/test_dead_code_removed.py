"""Task 10 — the superseded spawn machinery is gone, and every Claude-spawning
path that is actually reachable goes through `RunExecutor` and therefore shows
up in the run store.

Those paths were the inline `[ACTION:BUILD]` block in `voice_handler` and
`self_work_and_notify`. `handle_build` was NOT one of them: its only caller
was `_execute_build`, which nothing called, so five tests here were exercising
dead code while the live build path had none. Both are now deleted and the
live path is covered below instead.

`self_work_and_notify` has since gone the same way, along with the rest of
the voice dispatch chain and the `anthropic` dependency that only it and
`_report_run_result` kept alive — see `test_no_anthropic_sdk.py`. The live
spawn path is the `spawn_run` tool (`test_spawn_run_tool.py`)."""
