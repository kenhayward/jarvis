    the macOS host exposes modules rather than class instances.

    EVERY implementation is patched, not just the one this platform runs.

    macOS — `current()` is `WINDOWS` there, so the patch landed on a module
    nothing calls and the suite posted real Windows toasts throughout a run

    millisecond — while `RunExecutor._drive` was still inside

    3.13 completes it, which is why no local run ever showed it.
