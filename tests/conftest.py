    The CI hang, twice, on the macOS runner's Python 3.12 and never on 3.13:
    a test spawned a run, asserted on the row, and returned in the same
    millisecond — while `RunExecutor._drive` was still inside
    `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`, before the child existed. The loop's
    teardown then cancelled that task mid-spawn, and 3.12's subprocess
    transport never completes a cancellation delivered there: the suite sat
    in `_cancel_all_tasks` until GitHub killed the job 25 minutes later.
    3.13 completes it, which is why no local run ever showed it.

    the test's own loop, before the runner closes it. A test's fake `claude`
