"""The project scan must never run on the event loop.

`scan_projects` was `async def` with a wholly synchronous body — an iterdir()
over ~/Desktop and a read_text() on every repo's .git/HEAD. Nothing awaited,
so it ran to completion on the event loop thread and `/api/specs` and
`/api/projects` froze the entire server, voice WebSocket included, for as long
as the walk took. On a cloud-synced Desktop that was over ten minutes.
