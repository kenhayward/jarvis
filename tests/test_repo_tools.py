"""Repo awareness: the three readers, and the one opener.

The user's words: "I think he may also need a really fast way of reading into
a repo. Like what if I'm asking questions about the repo itself? and maybe he
should be able to open code files in VS Code or text editor."

JARVIS could see what SESSIONS were doing and knew nothing about the CODE, so
"what does chitauri actually do" cost a whole spawned run — minutes, and a
slice of the subscription, for a question a grep settles. These four tools are
plain filesystem work: no model, no `claude`, instant.

Which makes them the most dangerous tools in the set, because `project` and
`path` arrive from a microphone via a model, and a transcript from somebody
else's session can steer what the brain says. So most of this file is
refusals:

* every path is proved to resolve INSIDE the project, by resolving both sides
  — `..`, an absolute path elsewhere and a symlink out all fail the same way;
* the user's HOME is itself a project on this machine, so containment alone is
  far too permissive: `.ssh`, `.aws`, `.env`, keys and credentials are refused
  even when they are legitimately inside the resolved project;
* everything read out of a repository is wrapped as untrusted, exactly as a
  session transcript is — a README can carry an instruction aimed at the brain;
* nothing is unbounded: not the walk, not a search, not a file.

NOTHING here may open a real editor or read outside its tmp_path: `actions` is
mocked at the module boundary and the recorder asserts what it was handed.
