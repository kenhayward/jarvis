"""Connecting the user's own MCP servers — the doorway.

JARVIS ships with no calendar, no mail and no notes. What he has instead is
one file the user writes their own servers into, and the machinery here is
everything that makes writing that file enough: the file survives an upgrade,
the servers in it reach the brain, the brain's allowlist admits their tools,
anything that did not start is named out loud rather than silently missing,
their tool schemas do not eat the conversation, and what they return is
treated as a stranger's words.
