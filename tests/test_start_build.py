"""Real builds: the spec that survives, the brief that drives, the plan that reports.

`spawn_run` hands one sentence to one unattended turn. For a project that is
the wrong shape, in the user's own words: *"real builds is detailed planning
(brainstorm), specs and revising those specs (spec writing), and then phased
planning ... the more models get feedback and review and revise their own
specs/planning, the better the result is."*

Three properties are load-bearing here, and each one has a test that fails if
it is removed:

1. **The spec is written into the project before anything spawns.** It is the
   only artifact that outlives a compaction, a replaced session or JARVIS's
   own context rotation. Delete the write and `test_the_spec_is_written_into_
   the_project_before_anything_spawns` fails.
2. **The brief hands over the whole process** — read the settled spec, plan,
   *review and revise the plan*, execute with subagents, test-drive, verify,
   tick the checkboxes, decide rather than ask. Drop any of those and
   `test_the_brief_hands_over_the_whole_process` fails.
3. **`run_command` never runs anything unheard.** It stages; the read-back and
   its cancel window happen after the turn. Run it directly from the handler
   and `test_run_command_stages_and_runs_nothing_from_inside_the_tool_call`
   fails.

No test here spawns a real `claude`, opens a real Terminal window, or writes
outside tmp_path.
