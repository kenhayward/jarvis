"""The handover is model output, and it was spliced in as trusted prose.

`MEMORY_WRITERS` refuses `remember`, `project_note` and `write_journal` in a
tainted turn, because `MEMORY.md` loads into every later turn as trusted
system text. The journal is also written OUTSIDE `/internal/tool`, and that
route had no gate on it at all:

    _maybe_rotate -> _ask_for_journal   (asks the outgoing brain for free text)
                  -> jarvis_memory.write_journal   (writes it verbatim)
    launch_prompt -> latest_journal / self._handover
                  -> spliced RAW into the next generation's system prompt as
                     "your own note from the previous conversation"

`_boot_handover` makes it survive a restart, so the laundered text outlives
the process that read it. The handover TURN is untainted (`origin="system"`),
which is exactly why the per-turn gate never saw it — but the outgoing
brain's CONTEXT holds whatever it read that generation, and the note is
composed from that context.

Two things are wrong, and both are fixed:

1. The handover is model output. "Your own note" is a fiction — a generation
   is a process, not a self — and there is no version of this where a
   sentence a model wrote belongs in a system prompt as JARVIS's own words.
   So it is ALWAYS wrapped, in process and off disk alike. That is the
   property that holds even for a journal file written before this change.
2. Nothing recorded that a GENERATION had read untrusted content — only the
   turn in flight did. So option (a), "name the source when the outgoing
   generation was tainted", was not even expressible. `Brain` now carries
   `generation_untrusted_source`, it survives every turn of that generation,
   it is handed to the next generation with the note, and it is written into
   the journal file so it survives a restart too.

The class here is SOURCES OF TRUSTED TEXT reaching a new generation: the
in-process handover, the journal on disk, and every way a generation can
become tainted in the first place. The last of those is enumerated from
`server.TAINTING_TOOLS` and `brain.untrusted_tool_source`, not typed.

# --- 3b. what the NEXT generation may write down -------------------------
#
# The question this leaves open, asked plainly: after a rotation clears the
# taint, may the new generation `remember` something the tainted one had
# been told to remember by a web page?
#
# The answer this design can actually keep is "only if the user says it
# again, in his own words, to a generation that has read nothing" — and that
# is exactly what rotation-clears-taint plus the per-generation memory gate
# gives, PROVIDED the suggestion's own text does not cross the boundary as a
# fact. It does cross — the handover is how a conversation survives — so
# what matters is HOW. Three properties, and all three are asserted:
#
#   * it arrives inside an untrusted block, never as system prose;
#   * it is introduced as a note a model wrote, not as JARVIS's own;
#   * when its author had read something, the new generation is told what.
#
# The residual is named rather than hidden: a wrapped suggestion is still a
# suggestion sitting in a context that holds `remember`. `server.
# _untrusted_content_refusal` already says why nothing better is available —
# "nothing tracks where a sentence came from once it is in the brain's
# context" — and the user's voice on a clean turn is the only evidence there
# is. Deliberately NOT carrying the taint across the rotation: a taint that
# is inherited by every successor never clears, and a gate that can never be
# satisfied is a gate the user works around.
