"""Context budget and rotation.

The brain's window grows with every turn, which makes it slower and burns the
user's subscription. Crossing the budget *schedules* a rotation; the rotation
itself is performed at a conversational pause, so it can never cut the user off
mid-sentence.

Reuses the fake-brain harness from tests/test_brain.py — there is exactly one
stand-in `claude` in this suite.
