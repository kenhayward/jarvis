"""The repository question, answered in half a second instead of fifteen.

Measured on the very question the user asked ("what licence is this repo
under?"):

    gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/license   0.5s   MIT, exact
    WebFetch through a claude -p turn      9.2s   correct
    WebSearch through a claude -p turn    15.9s   correct, with sources

`gh` is installed and authenticated on this machine, and a large share of what
the user asks about is repositories. So repositories get a fast path, and it
takes what a person SAYS — "the arcreactor repo", "my Arc Loop repo" — because
that is what arrives out of speech recognition.

When the name is genuinely ambiguous it ASKS. Live, "arcreactor" matched five
repositories from five different owners and a web search could not tell which
was meant; picking one silently would have answered a licence question about
somebody else's code.

NOTHING here runs the real `gh` or touches the network. `_run_gh` is the one
seam and it is replaced; the two tests that must prove the subprocess itself
is safe run a fake `gh` written into tmp_path. Every fixture below is a real
`gh` output shape, captured from the live tool.
