"""`$` matches BEFORE a trailing newline, so `.match()` cannot answer "is the
WHOLE value this shape".

    >>> re.match(r"^[a-z]+$", "ok\\n")
    <re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='ok'>

`server._plain_name` was written that way and returned `'ok\\n'` — one
newline in a header line is one whole line of forged JARVIS. That was fixed
in `server.py`, and `tests/test_header_lines.py` holds every anchored pattern
IN THAT FILE to `fullmatch`. The same shape was sitting in four other
modules, on gates that decide real things:

    gh_lookup.FULL_NAME_RE   "owner/name\\n" is a valid repository name, and
                             the value reaches a header line
    builds._COMMAND_ALLOWED  the allowlist that decides what may be RUN in a
                             Terminal window: "npm start\\n…" passes it
    project_maker._SAFE_NAME the allowlist that decides what may become a
                             directory
    specs._HEADING           parsing, not a gate, but the same defect

So this file is not about `gh_lookup`. It walks every module in the
repository for the CLASS — a compiled pattern whose text ends in `$`, used
with `.match()` or `.search()` — and fails on any that is not on an
explicitly justified exempt list. Both spellings are found: a plain string
literal, and an f-string built out of sub-patterns (which is how
`FULL_NAME_RE` is written, and why a walk that only understood literals
would have missed the very pattern that started this).

The second half is behavioural, and it is the one that cannot be satisfied
by moving a character around: every whole-value check in the repository is
handed a value it accepts, with each of the ten separators `str.splitlines()`
knows about stuck on the end, and must refuse all of them.
