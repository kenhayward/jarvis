"""A path chosen AFTER containment was decided is a path nobody checked.

`_inside_a_project` and `repo_read.resolve_within` both realpath their
candidate and compare realpaths, so a symlink cannot make the comparison
lie. That is a decision about ONE path. `open_in_browser` then took the
answer and replaced it:

    if resolved.is_dir():
        index = next((resolved / n for n in _DIRECTORY_INDEXES
                      if (resolved / n).is_file()), None)
        resolved = index          # unresolved, and never re-contained
    ...
    if _too_private_to_open(resolved):

— so both walls judged the LINK and not its target. Executed:
`site/index.html` symlinked to `<data>/jarvis/mcp.json` (the loopback tool
token's path and a verbatim copy of every token in the user's
`connections.json`) came back "Opened index.html from demo, sir." Naming the
file is refused; naming its directory was not.

`repo_read.private_reason`'s own docstring already said whose job this is:
"The caller is responsible for having resolved symlinks first where that
matters."

So the universe here is not a file and not a function name. It is:

    every `*.py` at the top level of the repository, every function in which
    a name is bound — directly, or through a rebind or a tuple-unpack — to
    the result of `_inside_a_project`, `repo_read.resolve_within` or
    `project_maker.target_for`, and a NEW path is then derived from that
    name by `/`, `.joinpath`, `.glob`, `.rglob` or `.iterdir`.

Each one is driven below with a real symlink planted at the derived path, or
carries a written reason. A function that starts deriving a path after
containment next year is in the class the moment it does.
