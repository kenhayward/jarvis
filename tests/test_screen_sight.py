"""Seeing the user's screen — the cheap window list, and one deliberate picture.

The user, three times: "okay I ran it can you see my screen", "can you see my
screen if I pull it up", "we definitely need to give him ability to see the
screen and process it."

The screen module shipped in the first release and was deleted for being dead code
that routed through the Anthropic vision API. This is the same two
capabilities rebuilt on the subscription path: the window list (AppleScript,
a few hundred bytes) and a screenshot the brain SEES, which reaches it as an
MCP `image` content block — the one route into a `claude -p` process that has
no Read tool. `screencapture` and `sips` and nothing else.

NOTHING here captures the real screen. `screen._run` is the single subprocess
seam, and the fake writes the files a real `screencapture`/`sips` would.
The two exceptions are marked: they drive the REAL `sips` against synthetic
PNGs built here with zlib, because a blank-frame detector that has never seen
a real encoder is a detector that has never been tested.
