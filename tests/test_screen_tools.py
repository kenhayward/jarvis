"""The two screen tools, end to end through the tool channel.

`look_at_screen` is a picture the brain SEES: an MCP `image` content block on
the tool result, the one route into a `claude -p` process that has no Read
tool. `what_is_on_screen` is the cheap half — which app is in front and what
its windows are called, for a fraction of the cost of a single pixel.

NOTHING here captures the real screen: `screen` is mocked at the module
boundary, exactly as `browser` is in test_page_tools.py, and the recorder
asserts what it was asked for. Everything that waits has a deadline — a test
that hangs has told you nothing.
