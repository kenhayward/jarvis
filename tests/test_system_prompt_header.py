"""The system prompt is a header line that is read in EVERY generation.

`tests/test_header_lines.py` walks the class of functions that read a named
foreign FIELD and build text. The worst finding of the fourth audit is
structurally invisible to that walk, and would have been invisible to any
widening of it:

    projects = self._boot_projects()
    if projects:
        base += ("\\n\\nProjects with live Claude Code sessions right now: "
                 + ", ".join(sorted(set(projects))) + ".")

`_boot_projects` reads no field called `project`. It calls
`self.active_projects()`, a plugged-in callable that `server.py` sets to
`_active_project_names`, which is `s.project` — `Path(cwd).name` out of
`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, another process's file, the exact untrusted
string the whole `_plain_name` regime walls. Between the read and the print
sits a function boundary and an attribute assignment, so the name is gone by
the time the walk looks.

So the universe here is not fields. It is THE DESTINATION:

    every `*.py` at the top level of the repository, every argv element that
    is `--append-system-prompt`, `--system-prompt`, or either of their
    `-file` forms

— found in the source, so a second one written next year is in the class the
moment it exists. The function holding it must be named below, and the text
it passes is driven with a hostile value in EVERY input it reads.

Why this destination and not another: `--append-system-prompt` is not one
turn's context. It is prose the model is told is its own operator's, in every
generation of that process until it rotates, above and outside every
`<session-output>` block the per-turn regime relies on. There is no wrapper
here to close, because the whole string is already outside one.
