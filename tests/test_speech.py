# unacked is a chunk coming out of the speaker right now, which is exactly
# when its echo is loudest, and `inf > SHORT_ECHO_GRACE_SEC` handed the
# relaxation to every short word heard mid-sentence.

# ago). Each one has an answer and each answer is asserted.

# chunk goes out in one burst, and silently drops an URGENT utterance's
# remaining text from `_unread`.
