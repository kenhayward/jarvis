"""Drive the REAL dashboard bundle in a real browser, against a stub API.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
There are no frontend tests and there cannot be new ones of the usual kind:
`package.json` has no test runner and "no new npm dependencies" is a hard
rule, so Jest and Vitest are both out. Every honesty rule in
`frontend/src/dashboard/` was therefore enforced by a comment — including
three that the comment described correctly and the code did the opposite of:

  * a recovered usage fetch left "Cannot read the usage limits." on screen
    above two live gauges, for ever;
  * a failed transcript fetch rendered as an empty transcript, which is
    pixel-for-pixel a run that recorded nothing;
  * the Specs document scrolled back to the top on every checkbox tick,
    directly under a comment saying that would make the page unusable.

Those are behaviours of the assembled page, not of a function — a unit test
would have had to mock the DOM, the fetch layer and the module graph, and
would have passed against all three bugs. So this drives the built page.

WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT IT NEEDS
-------------------------------
`node` (to run `vite build`, already a dev dependency) and Playwright's
Chromium, which is already in `.venv` and already used by `browser.py`. No
new dependency of either kind. The bundle is built ONCE per session and only
when a source file is newer than it. If either is missing the tests skip
rather than fail: they are a real check on this machine, not a new
requirement for anyone cloning the repo.

THE ASYNC API, NEVER `sync_playwright`. The sync API drives its event loop
with greenlets on the calling thread, and it leaves that loop *running*
between calls: every pytest-asyncio test that ran after one of these in the
same session then died with "Runner.run() cannot be called from a running
event loop". Measured — 463 failures across the suite, none of them in the
code under test. `browser.py` uses the async API for the same reason.
