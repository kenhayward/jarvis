"""Finding things on the web, and the gate a poisoned page must not walk through.

The user, to JARVIS: "can you search that open SEO GitHub and read it yourself
so you can see what the license says" — and JARVIS had no way to find a URL he
did not already have. `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` are the CLI's own tools and
work inside the brain's exact flag set, so the capability is one line of
allowlist.

The cost of that line is the whole of this file. Everything those two tools
return is written by whoever owns the page, and it lands in the brain's context
with NO `_wrap_untrusted` around it — the CLI puts it there, not JARVIS, so
the wrapper JARVIS uses for `read_page` cannot reach it. The brain holds tools
that spawn processes. So a turn that has read the open web may not also act
unsupervised in that same turn.

Nothing here touches the network: the brain is the stand-in in tests/fixtures,
and the endpoint is driven through TestClient.
