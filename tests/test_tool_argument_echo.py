"""A tool's ARGUMENT is not JARVIS's own text either.

Every `tool_*` handler takes `args: dict` — the brain's own JSON. The brain
writes that JSON after reading whatever it just read: a file, a page, another
session's output, all of it inside an untrusted block. So a handler that
echoes an argument raw in its reply turns the contents of a block into a
line the brain then reads as JARVIS's own. Three audits in a row found one
such echo each — `search_repo`'s header (scrubbed), the resolver's "I don't
see a project called X" (scrubbed), and then `project_note`, `search_repo`'s
MISS branch and `open_in_editor`'s missing-file line, all in the same tool
set, all still raw — because each fix was a site and none was the class.

This is the class. The universe is every function in server.py with a
parameter named `args`, plus every module-level function one of those hands
a tainted value to — seeded transitively, to a fixed point, through
`asyncio.to_thread(f, …)` as well as a direct call. A name is TAINTED when
it is assigned from `args` (or a tainted parameter) through nothing but
string-shaping (`str`, `.strip()`, `.lower()`, `or ""`, `Path(...)`, a
`join`, a truncation), a PATH RESOLVER (`resolve_within`, `realpath`,
`relative_to` — the path that comes back is still the path that went in,
checked), or a PASS-THROUGH helper: one whose own `return` hands its
tainted input back reshaped (`_normalise_model`'s `return raw.strip()` was
one) — per tuple position, when it returns a tuple. A list something
tainted is appended to is tainted. A call to anything else is a decision
the callee made, and the callee is walked for its own echoes. A SITE is any
f-string field, `.format()` argument, string concatenation, or a HANDLER's
`return` (a handler being a function the dispatch table names) of anything
that carries a tainted name — unless a sanitiser stands over it, or the
text is consumed by one (built, then handed to `_wrap_untrusted`). A
sanitiser is one of the six below, or any function whose every return is
one. A log line is not a site. All of it decided structurally, not by a
written exemption.

The eighth audit's finding against the first version of this file was that
taint died at every call; the ninth's, that it died at `to_thread` and at a
path resolver, and that `_cap_tool_result` was listed as a sanitiser when
it only truncates. Every one of those shapes is in SYNTHETIC now, so the
walk cannot regress without going red.

The walk is proven against a synthetic module that has every shape of echo,
the real module must have none, and every site the walk found on the trees
it was written against is also driven by execution.
