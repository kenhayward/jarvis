"""Every reader of somebody else's words taints the turn — not just the web ones.

The gate was built for `WebFetch` and stayed there. `read_page`,
`look_at_page`, `github_repo` and the CLI's own two set it; `read_file`,
`search_repo`, `repo_overview`, `session_detail`, `list_sessions`,
`run_status`, `build_status`, `review_document` and `look_at_screen` did not.
Those are every reader of repository files, of other sessions' transcripts, of
run output and of the user's screen — and a README is written by a stranger
exactly as a web page is.

So the shortest path to an unattended `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
never touched the web at all:

    "what's in that repo?" → read_file returns an attacker's README →
    same turn, origin "user", turn clean → spawn_run

`remember` was the durable one. `jarvis_memory.write_memory` puts the model's
text verbatim into `memory/*.md` and `MEMORY.md`, and `MEMORY.md` is
`@`-imported into every future turn as TRUSTED system text. One injection was
permanent.

This file drives the real `/internal/tool` endpoint, with a real repository on
disk holding a real hostile README, and asserts on what the endpoint actually
returns and on what is actually on disk afterwards.
