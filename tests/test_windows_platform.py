"""The Windows host, tested from a Mac.

Everything here mocks the one subprocess seam per module, so it runs on any
platform — which is the point. What it CANNOT prove is that the argv it
pins actually do what they claim on Windows; that needs a real box. So the
tests are written to be the correction surface: each one pins a decision,
and sample command output is quoted from documentation rather than
measurement. Replace a sample with a real one and the failure will say
exactly what has to move.

Read `jarvis_platform/windows/secrets.py`'s module docstring first.
